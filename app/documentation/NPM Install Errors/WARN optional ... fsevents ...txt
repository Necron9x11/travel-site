npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.4 (node_modules/fsevents):
npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.4: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

This is only a warning. It is not an error. fsevents is an optional dependency,
for MacOS projects. On a Mac it provides 'Native Access to Mac OS-X FSEvents'.

So, if you are developing your project on a Windows system or a Linux system
you have no need for the fsevents module and it is not loaded.

QUESTION: Is there some way to tel npm that this is a Linux system and thus suppress
the annoyingly repetetive warning messages it generates?
